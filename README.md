Every month had to go spelunking for the commits and manually collect their data to fill in the creative hours protocol.
This app helps automate part of that process and save some time.

Live version: https://lawfx.github.io/protocol-pal/

## Steps:
1. Login to Github
   - Currently you need to manually paste in your token
2. Choose the month for which you want to create the protocol for and fill in your creative hours
4. Load the protocol template (.docx)
   - Unfortunately you need to provide your own template since I can't have company documents as public
5. Choose the commits you want to include
   - You can edit the messages, the PR numbers and ~~the hours you spent on it~~ assign random hours
6. Click Generate
7. ...
8. Profit
